# Scaling to 10+ Teams: Architecture Guide

## 🎯 Why Separate Configs at Scale?

### Current Approach (Single Config) - Good for ≤5 Teams
```
playwright.config.ts (200 lines)
├── adobe project
├── search project
├── auth project
└── ai project
```

**Problems at scale:**
- ❌ Merge conflicts increase exponentially
- ❌ One team's mistake can break all tests
- ❌ Difficult to assign code ownership
- ❌ Config file becomes 1000+ lines
- ❌ Hard to maintain different settings per team

### Recommended Approach (Separate Configs) - Scales to 100+ Teams
```
config/
├── playwright.config.base.ts      # Shared defaults
└── teams/
    ├── adobe.config.ts             # Adobe team owns this
    ├── search.config.ts            # Search team owns this
    ├── auth.config.ts              # Auth team owns this
    └── [10+ more team configs]     # Each team independent
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Each team maintains their own config
- ✅ Zero cross-team impact
- ✅ Clear code ownership (CODEOWNERS file)
- ✅ Parallel development without conflicts
- ✅ Team-specific settings isolated
- ✅ Easy onboarding for new teams

```

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Base Config (Shared)
All teams inherit from this base configuration.

### Step 2: Create Team-Specific Configs
Each team has full control over their config.

### Step 3: Set Up CODEOWNERS
Define who owns what files.

### Step 4: Update Package.json
Scripts to run any team's tests.

### Step 5: CI/CD Pipeline
Run tests in parallel per team.

---

## 🔒 Team Isolation Guarantees

### 1. File Ownership
```
.github/CODEOWNERS
---
/teams/adobe-team/          @adobe-team
/config/teams/adobe.config.ts @adobe-team

/teams/search-team/         @search-team
/config/teams/search.config.ts @search-team
```

### 2. Independent Updates
- Team A changes their config → Only Team A tests affected
- Team B adds new tests → Zero impact on Team A
- Team C updates selectors → Other teams unaffected

### 3. Parallel CI/CD
```yaml
# .github/workflows/playwright.yml
strategy:
  matrix:
    team: [adobe, search, auth, payment, analytics, ...]
  fail-fast: false  # One team's failure doesn't stop others
```

### 4. Team-Specific Settings
Each team can customize:
- Timeout values
- Retry logic
- Browser selection
- Environment URLs
- Reporter settings
- Viewport sizes
- Test directories

---

## 🚀 Migration Path

### Phase 1: Create Structure (No Breaking Changes)
1. Create `config/playwright.config.base.ts`
2. Create `config/teams/` directory
3. Keep current `playwright.config.ts` working

### Phase 2: Move Teams One by One
1. Move adobe team first (pilot)
2. Verify tests still pass
3. Move remaining teams gradually
4. Each team can migrate on their schedule

### Phase 3: Clean Up
1. Remove old `playwright.config.ts`
2. Update documentation
3. Train teams on new structure

## 📊 Comparison: Before vs After

### Before (Single Config)
```typescript
// playwright.config.ts (500+ lines for 10+ teams)
export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    { name: 'adobe-chromium', testDir: './teams/adobe-team', use: {...} },
    { name: 'adobe-firefox', testDir: './teams/adobe-team', use: {...} },
    { name: 'search-chromium', testDir: './teams/search-team', use: {...} },
    { name: 'search-firefox', testDir: './teams/search-team', use: {...} },
    // ... 50+ more projects for 10+ teams
  ]
});
```

**Issues:**
- 500+ lines, hard to navigate
- All teams touch the same file
- Merge conflicts daily
- One syntax error breaks all teams

### After (Separate Configs)
```typescript
// config/teams/adobe.config.ts (50 lines)
import { baseConfig } from '../playwright.config.base';

export default defineConfig({
  ...baseConfig,
  testDir: '../../teams/adobe-team',
  projects: [
    { name: 'adobe-chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
    { name: 'adobe-firefox', use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },
  ]
});
```

**Benefits:**
- 50 lines per team, focused and clear
- Adobe team owns their file
- Zero merge conflicts
- Independent changes

## 🎓 Best Practices for Scale

### 1. Naming Conventions
```
✅ Good: adobe.config.ts, search.config.ts
❌ Bad: team1.config.ts, config-2.ts
```

### 2. Shared Code Location
```
shared/
├── base-page.ts        # All teams can use
├── test-data.ts        # Shared test data
└── utils/              # Common utilities
```

### 3. Environment Management
```typescript
// config/environments.ts
export const ENVIRONMENTS = {
  adobe: {
    dev: 'https://adobe-dev.example.com',
    stage: 'https://adobe-stage.example.com',
    prod: 'https://www.adobe.com'
  },
  search: {
    dev: 'https://search-dev.example.com',
    stage: 'https://search-stage.example.com',
    prod: 'https://search.example.com'
  }
  // ... 10+ more teams
};
```

### 4. Team Onboarding Checklist
- [ ] Create `config/teams/[teamname].config.ts`
- [ ] Create `teams/[teamname]/` directory
- [ ] Add team to `CODEOWNERS`
- [ ] Add npm scripts to `package.json`
- [ ] Document team-specific settings
- [ ] Add to CI/CD pipeline

---

## 🔄 Continuous Integration Strategy

### Parallel Execution
```yaml
# .github/workflows/playwright.yml
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        team:
          - adobe
          - search
          - auth
          - payment
          - analytics
          # ... 10+ teams
      fail-fast: false
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm run test:${{ matrix.team }}
```

### Benefits:
- Each team runs in parallel
- 10 teams = same time as 1 team
- Failures are isolated
- Easy to identify which team has issues

## 📈 Scalability Metrics

| Metric | Single Config | Separate Configs |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Config file size** | 500+ lines | 50 lines/team |
| **Merge conflicts** | High | Rare |
| **Blast radius** | All teams | Single team |
| **Onboarding time** | 2-3 days | 1-2 hours |
| **Team independence** | Low | High |
| **Maintenance burden** | Centralized | Distributed |
| **CI/CD complexity** | High | Low |

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

For **10+ teams**:

### ✅ Use Separate Configs
- Each team maintains their own config
- Changes are isolated
- Scales to 100+ teams
- Clear ownership

### ✅ Implement Gradually
- Start with 2-3 pilot teams
- Migrate remaining teams over 1-2 sprints
- No breaking changes required

### ✅ Use CODEOWNERS
- Enforce team ownership
- Automatic review assignments
- Clear accountability

---

## 🚦 Decision Matrix

```
Team Count: 1-5 teams
├── Single Config ✅ RECOMMENDED
└── Simple, centralized, easy to manage

Team Count: 6-10 teams
├── Single Config ⚠️ WORKS BUT...
│   └── Starting to show strain
└── Separate Configs ✅ CONSIDER MIGRATION

Team Count: 10+ teams
├── Single Config ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED
│   └── Merge conflicts, blast radius
└── Separate Configs ✅ STRONGLY RECOMMENDED
    └── Scalable, isolated, maintainable
```

## 📚 Next Steps

1. Review the implementation files I'll create
2. Choose pilot teams for migration
3. Test the new structure
4. Roll out to remaining teams
5. Update CI/CD pipeline
